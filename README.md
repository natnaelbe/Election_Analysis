#Overview of Election Audit
##  For deliverable 1, the task is to break down our election results using python syntax. The election audit results have been submitted. However, the commission has requested additional data: voter turnout, percentage of voters from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. For loops and conditional statements must be included along with membership and logical operators. The results are supposed to be printed out and saved to a file named election_results. For deliverable 2, this output examines the outcome of the election. It is categorically separated by county votes, largest county turnout, and candidate winner. 
# Election Audit Results
## From the election_results.txt file, 369,711 votes were cast.
## Out of those number of votes, Jefferson County had 10.5% of the total votes. Denver nearly had 83% of the total votes, and Arapahoe obtained 6.7% of the total votes. As a result, Denver had the largest amount of votes. 
## Diana DeGette won the election. She won with 272,892 votes with a winning percentage close to 74%
# Election-Audit Summary
## One modification I would make is to present the results in a visually in another tab. This would be placed on an additional tab displaying the total number of outcomes. We can do the same thing with the percentage values by displaying a pie chart. For the voting count, I would have labeled the amount of votes because looking at how it is represented makes it seem like a percentage value is being multiplied by the total amount. Having votes written inside the parentheses would have probably avoided confusion. Leaving spaces between the percent and the parentheses would have been more cleaner to read.
